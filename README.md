# About graphonline

This is source code of graphonline service. Graphonline helps visualize graph and applies a lot of algorithms.

# License

MIT License.

# Requirements

Client side:
1. HTML5 support of client side.

Server side:
1. PHP 5.6
2. Binary cgi supports. It needs for some algorithm, but almost all can work without it.

# How to run

1. Download repository to local website folder. It should be placed into root of domen. If you want to run graphonline from subdirectory read "Additional steps to run from subdirectory" below.
2. Change access rights of directory /tmp. PHP scripts need to create and modify files inside it.
3. Run file from browser: /script/merge.php. It merges all js files into one /script/example.js.
4. Run file from browser: /cgi-bin/getPluginsList.php?reset. It creates file with list of plug-ins. Just optimization.
5. Change default root password in file: /core/config/admin_sector.php
```
$g_config['admin_sector']['def_pwd'] = 'rootPass';
```
6. Change password to wiki. Change lines:
```
$DefaultPasswords['admin'] = pmcrypt('pas');
$DefaultPasswords['edit'] = pmcrypt('pas');
```
In files:
/wiki/local/config.php
/en/wiki/local/config.php

7. Maybe you need to disable autoredirect to https. Comments or remove lines:
```
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
```
In files:
/.htaccess
/wiki/.htaccess
/en/wiki/.htaccess

8. Some algorithms use binary CGI file (short-path, Eulerian cycle/path and so on). If you want to run them, you need to compile GraphOffline util: https://github.com/UnickSoft/GraphOffline. And place it with name /cgi-bin/GraphCGI.exe or you can take precompiled file(Windows and Mac) from /cgi-bin/GraphOffline/

# Docker

docker-compose up

# Additional steps to run from subdirectory:

For example you place graphonline sources into http://localhost/graph/ directory.

1. Edit .htaccess change RewriteRule to line:
```
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /graph/index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA]
```
2. Write your directory name to script\main.js variable SiteDirs:
```
var SiteDir     = "graph/";
```
3. Write your directory to core config core\config\main.php in line SITE_IN_DIR:
```
define('SITE_IN_DIR',   'graph');
```
4. Run merge.php to apply changes. Run http://localhost/graph/script/merge.php
